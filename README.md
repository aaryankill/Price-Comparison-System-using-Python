# Price-Comparison-System-using-Python
This project aims to be able to enable users to get the information regarding a particular product form Amazon and Flipkart 

(This is still not the final product as it has loads and loads of problems with it, mainly in its high time complexity but other than that I have tried to make this as easy to understand as possible.
With that out of the way, I will be glad for any improvements that you can make to the project.)

I'll add further details as time passes for a bit more detailed functioning of the code
